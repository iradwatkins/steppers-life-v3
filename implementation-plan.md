### âœ… B-011: Real-time Inventory Management System - Done
**Story:** As an event organizer, I need a real-time inventory management system that prevents overselling and accurately tracks ticket availability across all sales channels, so that buyers can't purchase tickets that aren't available and I can monitor capacity in real-time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- âœ… **AC1:** System tracks real-time ticket quantities for each event and ticket type
- âœ… **AC2:** Checkout process places temporary inventory holds (5-minute timeout) during ticket selection
- âœ… **AC3:** Inventory holds are released automatically on timeout or checkout abandonment  
- âœ… **AC4:** System prevents overselling by blocking purchases when capacity reached
- âœ… **AC5:** Admin dashboard shows real-time inventory status with visual indicators
- âœ… **AC6:** Inventory updates immediately across all user sessions when tickets are purchased
- âœ… **AC7:** Support for different ticket types with separate capacity limits
- âœ… **AC8:** Integration with existing checkout flow (B-002) and cash payment system (B-007)
- âœ… **AC9:** Organizer can set and modify event capacity limits
- âœ… **AC10:** System shows "sold out" status when capacity reached
