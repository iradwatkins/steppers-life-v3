### Styling Approach

* **Chosen Styling Solution:** **Tailwind CSS** (Latest stable, e.g., 3.x) will be the primary styling methodology, leveraging its utility-first approach for rapid development and consistency.
* **Configuration File(s):** tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js.
* **Key Conventions:**
    * Theme customizations (colors, fonts, spacing based on Steppers Life\_ Comprehensive UI\_UX Layou.pdf) will be defined in tailwind.config.js under theme.extend.
    * Global base styles and Tailwind directives (@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;) will be in src/index.css or a similar global stylesheet.
    * Reusable component styles that are complex or require more semantic grouping than utility classes alone can provide will be defined using @apply within component-specific CSS/SCSS modules or global styles, or encapsulated within Shadcn/UI components.
    * Utility libraries like clsx and tailwind-merge will be used for conditional and combined class name management.
