### N. Initial User Dashboard & Role Activation
* **N.1. Generic User Dashboard:** Upon first sign-up, users have a basic dashboard.
* **N.2. "Post" Functionality:** A prominent "+ Post" (or similar) button on the generic dashboard.
* **N.3. Content Creation Options:** Clicking "Post" reveals options such as: "Post an Event," "List a Physical Class," "Offer a VOD Class," "List Your Service," "List Your Store."
* **N.4. Dashboard Extension:** Upon successful submission of content (e.g., first event, class, service/store listing), the user's dashboard dynamically extends to include the relevant management tabs and features for that new role/content (e.g., Promoter Dashboard, Instructor Dashboard sections appear).
* **N.5. User-Selectable Night Mode:**
    * The platform must offer at least two themes: a standard (light) theme and a "Night Mode" (dark) theme.
    * End-users must have an easily accessible control (e.g., a toggle switch in the site header or within their user settings) to switch between these themes.
    * The user's selected theme preference should be saved and applied consistently during their sessions.
    * Both themes must adhere to accessibility guidelines for contrast and readability.
