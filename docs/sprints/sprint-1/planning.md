## Definition of Done
- Code implemented and passes unit tests
- Feature is deployed to staging environment
- Integration tests pass
- Code reviewed by at least one other developer
- UI matches design specifications
- Feature is tested on mobile and desktop
- Documentation updated as needed

## Technical Dependencies
- Authentication token storage mechanism
- API service layer structure
- Error handling patterns
- Integration test framework

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| API changes during integration | Medium | High | Daily sync with backend team, clear API documentation |
| Payment gateway integration issues | Medium | High | Start early, dedicate experienced developer |
| Mobile responsiveness challenges | Low | Medium | Test on multiple devices throughout development |
| Performance issues with real data | Medium | Medium | Implement pagination and loading states |

## Sprint Planning Notes
- Focus on vertical slices of functionality rather than horizontal layers
- Prioritize authentication integration as it's a prerequisite for other features
- Backend team will be available for support and any required API adjustments
- Daily standups at 10:00 AM to coordinate frontend-backend integration

## Success Metrics
- Users can register, log in, and reset passwords
- Users can view real events from the database
- Event organizers can create events with images
- Users can purchase tickets with Square payments
- All integration tests pass in staging environment
