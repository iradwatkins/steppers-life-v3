\# Technical Preferences for {Project Name}

This document outlines specific technical preferences, preferred patterns, and technologies to consider (or avoid) during the architecture and development of the {Project Name} platform. This complements the main PRD and will guide the Architect.

\#\# I. Overall Architectural Approach

\* \*\*Repository Structure:\*\* A \*\*Polyrepo approach with two primary GitHub repositories\*\* is generally preferred:  
    1\.  One for the Frontend Application.  
    2\.  One for any Custom Backend Services (if needed beyond BaaS capabilities).  
\* \*\*Service Architecture:\*\*  
    \* Primarily leverage a \*\*Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) like Supabase\*\* for core backend needs (Database, Auth, Storage, Serverless Functions).  
    \* If dedicated backend services are required for complex logic not suitable for BaaS serverless functions, these will reside in the separate backend repository, likely as a \*\*Modular Monolith\*\* to begin with.

\#\# II. Frontend Application (Frontend Repository)

\* \*\*Primary Framework & Build Tool:\*\* \*\*React\*\* (latest stable version) using \*\*Vite\*\* (latest stable version) as the build tool and development server. Utilize SWC for fast compilation.  
\* \*\*Programming Language:\*\* \*\*TypeScript\*\*.  
\* \*\*Styling:\*\*  
    \* \*\*Tailwind CSS\*\* (latest stable version) is the preferred utility-first CSS framework.  
    \* Utilize \*\*PostCSS\*\* and \*\*Autoprefixer\*\*.  
    \* CSS Variables for theming (e.g., using a library like \*\*Next Themes\*\* if adaptable, or a custom solution for light/dark modes).  
\* \*\*UI Component Strategy:\*\*  
    \* \*\*Shadcn/UI\*\* (leveraging \*\*Radix UI\*\* primitives) is the preferred approach for UI components.  
    \* \*\*Icons:\*\* \*\*Lucide React\*\* or a similar comprehensive SVG icon library.  
\* \*\*Routing:\*\* \*\*React Router DOM\*\* (latest stable version) for client-side routing in Vite \+ React applications. (If Next.js is chosen for a project, its built-in router would be used).  
\* \*\*State Management & Data Fetching:\*\*  
    \* \*\*Server State, Data Fetching & Caching:\*\* \*\*React Query (TanStack Query)\*\* (latest stable version).  
    \* \*\*Form State Management:\*\* \*\*React Hook Form\*\* (latest stable version).  
    \* \*\*Client-Side Global State:\*\* Start with \*\*React's built-in Context API\*\*. If more complex global client-side state management is needed, evaluate and implement a lightweight library like \*\*Zustand or Jotai\*\*.  
\* \*\*Key Utility Libraries (Examples):\*\*  
    \* Schema Validation: \*\*Zod\*\*.  
    \* CSS Class Utilities: \*\*Class Variance Authority, clsx, Tailwind Merge\*\*.  
    \* Date Manipulation: \*\*date-fns\*\*.

\#\# III. Backend & Database

\* \*\*Primary Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS): Supabase\*\* (or a similar comprehensive BaaS platform offering PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Serverless Functions).  
\* \*\*Custom Backend Services (Backend Repository \- if needed):\*\*  
    \* \*\*Language/Framework:\*\* \*\*Node.js with Express.js (using TypeScript)\*\* is a strong default for consistency with a TypeScript frontend and good performance for web APIs.  
\* \*\*API Design (for custom backend services):\*\* Prefer \*\*RESTful APIs\*\* with clear versioning.

\#\# IV. Development Practices & Tooling

\* \*\*Version Control:\*\* \*\*Git\*\* with \*\*GitHub\*\* (or preferred platform like GitLab/Bitbucket).  
\* \*\*Code Quality:\*\* \*\*ESLint\*\* (with TypeScript ESLint plugins) and \*\*Prettier\*\*.  
\* \*\*Testing:\*\*  
    \* Frontend: \*\*Jest or Vitest\*\* with \*\*React Testing Library\*\* (unit/integration). \*\*Playwright or Cypress\*\* (E2E).  
    \* Backend: Jest or similar for Node.js/TypeScript.  
\* \*\*CI/CD:\*\* \*\*GitHub Actions\*\* (or chosen platform's CI/CD solution).  
\* \*\*Hosting:\*\*  
    \* Frontend: Platforms like \*\*Vercel, Netlify\*\*, or evaluate user's preferred hosting (e.g., Hostinger) for Vite/Node.js app compatibility.  
    \* Backend (BaaS): Handled by BaaS provider.  
    \* Custom Backend Services: Suitable cloud environment supporting Node.js (e.g., Docker containers on chosen cloud).

\#\# V. Technologies/Patterns to Actively AVOID  
\* (To be populated per project if specific technologies or patterns are identified as undesirable).

\#\# VI. Other Preferences  
\* Strive for a cohesive stack, avoiding redundant tools.  
\* Ensure components and services are designed for easy integration and maintainability.  
\* Prioritize security best practices throughout the stack.  
\* Emphasize clear, well-documented code.
