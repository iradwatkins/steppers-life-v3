# ADR 0002: Use FastAPI for Backend API Development

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The SteppersLife platform requires a robust, scalable, and maintainable backend API to support the following needs:
- User authentication and authorization
- Event management
- Ticketing and payment processing
- File uploads and media handling
- Real-time notifications
- Integration with third-party services

We needed to select a backend framework that would allow for rapid development while maintaining good performance, type safety, and documentation standards.

## Decision
We will use FastAPI as the primary framework for developing the SteppersLife backend API, along with the following key components:
- SQLAlchemy for ORM and database interactions
- Pydantic for data validation and serialization
- JWT for authentication
- Alembic for database migrations
- Pytest for testing

FastAPI was chosen for the following reasons:
1. **Performance**: FastAPI is built on Starlette and Uvicorn, providing high performance comparable to Node.js and Go
2. **Type Safety**: Native integration with Python type hints provides better developer experience and fewer bugs
3. **Automatic Documentation**: OpenAPI and Swagger UI are automatically generated
4. **Modern Python Features**: Takes advantage of Python 3.6+ features
5. **Async Support**: Built-in support for async/await patterns for handling concurrent requests
6. **Validation**: Robust request validation via Pydantic
7. **Developer Experience**: Clear error messages and intuitive API design

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Django + Django REST Framework**:
   - Pros: Mature ecosystem, comprehensive feature set
   - Cons: Heavier framework, slower development iteration, less performant for API-only applications

2. **Flask + Flask-RESTful**:
   - Pros: Lightweight, flexible
   - Cons: Requires more manual configuration, less built-in support for modern API features

3. **Express.js (Node.js)**:
   - Pros: Large ecosystem, good performance
   - Cons: Would require switching to JavaScript/TypeScript, potential for callback hell

## Consequences
### Positive
- Faster API development with automatic validation and documentation
- Better type safety leading to fewer runtime errors
- Excellent performance for API endpoints
- Smooth integration with async Python code for handling concurrent requests
- Modern codebase that's easier to maintain

### Negative
- Newer framework with a smaller community compared to Django or Flask
- Fewer out-of-the-box features compared to Django
- Team members need to learn FastAPI specifics
- Less mature ecosystem for some extensions

## Implementation
The backend API is implemented with the following structure:
- `/backend/app/api/` - API routes and endpoints
- `/backend/app/models/` - SQLAlchemy models
- `/backend/app/schemas/` - Pydantic schemas
- `/backend/app/core/` - Core functionality (auth, config, etc.)
- `/backend/app/services/` - Business logic services
- `/backend/app/utils/` - Utility functions

API versioning is handled via path prefixes (e.g., `/api/v1/`), and documentation is available at `/docs`.
