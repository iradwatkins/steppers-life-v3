# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting important technical and design decisions made during the SteppersLife project development following BMAD methodology.

## ADR Process

1. **Identify Decision**: When a significant architectural or design decision needs to be made
2. **Create ADR**: Use the template to document the decision
3. **Review**: Have the decision reviewed by relevant BMAD agents (Architect, Design Architect, etc.)
4. **Approve**: Get final approval from PO or lead
5. **Implement**: Proceed with implementation based on the decision
6. **Update**: Modify ADR if decision changes over time

## ADR Status

- **Proposed**: Decision is being considered
- **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and will be implemented
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer decision
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer relevant

## BMAD Integration

ADRs are created and reviewed using BMAD agents:

- **Architect Agent**: Creates technical architecture ADRs
- **Design Architect Agent**: Creates frontend/UI architecture ADRs  
- **PM Agent**: Reviews ADRs for business alignment
- **PO Agent**: Final approval and strategic oversight
- **Dev Agents**: Implement decisions documented in ADRs

## Decision Categories

### Technical Architecture
- Backend technology choices
- Database design decisions
- API design patterns
- Security architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- Component library selections
- State management approaches
- Routing strategies
- Build and deployment pipeline

### Design & UX
- UI framework decisions
- Design system choices
- Accessibility approaches
- Mobile-first strategies

### Business Logic
- Feature implementation approaches
- Integration strategies
- Performance optimization decisions
- Scalability considerations

## Current Decisions

Key decisions already made and documented:

1. **Backend**: Supabase as primary BaaS platform
2. **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Vite
3. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn/UI components
4. **Architecture**: Progressive Web App (PWA) approach
5. **Payment**: Multi-provider strategy (Square, PayPal, Cash App)
6. **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with social login options

## Usage Guidelines

- All significant technical decisions should have an ADR
- ADRs should be created before major implementation begins
- Include context, options considered, and rationale
- Keep ADRs concise but comprehensive
- Update ADRs when decisions evolve
- Reference ADRs in code and documentation when relevant
