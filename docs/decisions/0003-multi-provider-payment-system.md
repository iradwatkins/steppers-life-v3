# ADR 0003: Implement Multi-Provider Payment System

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The SteppersLife platform requires a robust payment processing system to handle ticket sales, event registrations, and other financial transactions. Key requirements include:

- Support for multiple payment methods to maximize user convenience
- Reliable transaction processing with proper error handling
- Support for refunds and payment adjustments
- Ability to handle international payments
- Compliance with payment industry standards and regulations
- Scalability to handle growing transaction volumes

Additionally, different user demographics may prefer different payment methods, and different regions may have varying availability and preferences for payment options.

## Decision
We will implement a multi-provider payment system that supports the following payment methods:

1. **Square** (primary provider)
   - Credit/debit card processing
   - Cash App integration

2. **PayPal**
   - PayPal account payments
   - Guest checkout with credit cards

3. **Cash App** (direct integration)
   - $Cashtag payments
   - QR code payments

4. **Cash Payments**
   - Verification code system for in-person payments
   - Manual validation by event staff

The system will be implemented with an abstraction layer that:
- Provides a unified interface for payment operations across providers
- Handles provider-specific implementation details
- Allows for easy addition of new payment providers in the future
- Maintains detailed transaction records regardless of provider

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Single Payment Provider (Square Only)**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, unified reporting
   - Cons: Limited payment options, higher risk if provider has issues

2. **Stripe as Primary Provider**
   - Pros: Developer-friendly API, extensive documentation
   - Cons: Higher fees for US-based dance community, less direct integration with Cash App

3. **Custom Payment Processing**
   - Pros: No transaction fees, complete control
   - Cons: Extremely high regulatory burden, security risks, maintenance overhead

## Consequences

### Positive
- Greater flexibility for users to pay with their preferred method
- Increased conversion rates by supporting multiple payment options
- Redundancy if one payment provider experiences issues
- Better support for international event attendees
- Organizers can receive payouts through their preferred method

### Negative
- More complex implementation requiring provider-specific code
- Challenge of maintaining consistent user experience across payment methods
- Need to reconcile transactions across multiple providers
- Potential for increased support complexity when troubleshooting
- More complex security requirements and compliance considerations

## Implementation
The payment system is implemented with the following components:

- `PaymentService` class with provider-specific implementations
- Unified payment intent creation flow with provider selection
- Webhook handlers for asynchronous payment notifications
- Database models for tracking payment status across providers
- Comprehensive logging and error handling
- Transaction reporting that aggregates across providers

The system is abstracted so that frontend components can interact with a unified payment interface, regardless of the selected provider.
