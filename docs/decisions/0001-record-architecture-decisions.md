# ADR 0001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
During the development of SteppersLife, we need to make significant decisions about the architecture and design of the platform. These decisions should be:

1. Documented in a consistent format
2. Tracked over time
3. Easily accessible to all team members
4. Provide context for why decisions were made

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are a lightweight method to document important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions made during the development of SteppersLife.

Each ADR will be:
- Written in Markdown format
- Stored in the `docs/decisions/` directory
- Named with a sequential number and short title (e.g., `0001-record-architecture-decisions.md`)
- Follow a consistent template (`adr-template.md`)
- Referenced in code comments and documentation when relevant

## Consequences
### Positive
- Improved communication and transparency about architectural decisions
- Historical record of decision-making process
- Clear understanding of trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Easier onboarding for new team members
- Adherence to BMAD methodology principles of documentation

### Negative
- Additional effort required to document decisions
- Risk of outdated ADRs if not maintained
- Could become overly bureaucratic if used for minor decisions

## Implementation
The following tasks will be completed:
1. Create an ADR template (`adr-template.md`)
2. Document all existing key architectural decisions
3. Establish a process for creating new ADRs when significant decisions are made
4. Reference ADRs in code and other documentation
