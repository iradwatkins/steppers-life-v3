# Story D.002: PWA Check-in Interface & QR Scanning for Event Staff

## Status: âœ… Done

## Story

- As an **event staff member using the PWA**
- I want **a fast, intuitive check-in interface with QR code scanning and manual lookup capabilities on my mobile device**
- so that **I can efficiently process attendees at event entrances, validate tickets in real-time, handle edge cases like forgotten tickets, and maintain smooth event flow even with poor connectivity**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1:** PWA-optimized QR code scanner with camera integration and fast scanning performance
2. **AC2:** Real-time ticket validation with instant visual feedback (green/red indicators, sounds)
3. **AC3:** Offline check-in capability with local queue and automatic sync when online
4. **AC4:** Manual attendee lookup by name, email, or phone number with fuzzy search
5. **AC5:** Guest list management with VIP identification and special accommodation notes
6. **AC6:** Duplicate ticket detection and already-checked-in status validation
7. **AC7:** Check-in analytics visible to staff (count, capacity, arrival rate)
8. **AC8:** Emergency manual override for technical issues or special circumstances
9. **AC9:** Multi-event support allowing staff to switch between assigned events quickly
10. **AC10:** Integration with existing attendance tracking system from B-014
11. **AC11:** Touch-optimized interface designed for various mobile screen sizes
12. **AC12:** Backup check-in methods (manual entry, fallback modes) for technical failures

## Dev Technical Guidance

- Use getUserMedia API for camera access with proper permission prompts and error handling
- Implement QR code detection with jsQR or qr-scanner library optimized for mobile performance
- Create IndexedDB-based offline queue with encryption for sensitive attendee data
- Use Web Worker for QR processing to maintain UI responsiveness during scanning
- Implement proper error boundaries and fallback UI for camera/scanning failures
- Add haptic feedback (vibration) for successful scans on supported devices
- Use Intersection Observer for efficient list rendering in attendee lookup
- Implement proper loading states and skeleton screens for better perceived performance
- Add proper ARIA labels and accessibility features for inclusive design
- Use CSS transforms for smooth animations and transitions in mobile interface
- Implement proper touch gesture handling (swipe, pinch) for mobile interaction
- Add proper network state detection and user feedback for connectivity issues
- Use service worker messaging for background sync coordination
- Implement proper memory management for camera streams and cleanup
