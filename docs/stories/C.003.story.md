## Dev Technical Guidance

- Use React DnD (react-beautiful-dnd) for drag-and-drop functionality between collections
- Implement collection state management with React Context or global state
- Create reusable components for different view modes (grid, list, calendar)
- Add infinite scroll or pagination for large event portfolios
- Use React Table or similar for advanced filtering and sorting capabilities
- Implement collection caching for performance optimization
- Add keyboard shortcuts for power user workflows
- Create responsive design for mobile collection management
- Implement proper error handling and optimistic updates
- Add undo/redo functionality for bulk operations
