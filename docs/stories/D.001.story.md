# Story D.001: PWA Setup & Secure Login for Organizers & Staff

## Status: âœ… Done

## Story

- As an **event organizer or authorized staff member**
- I want **a progressive web app (PWA) with secure login and role-based access for on-site event management**
- so that **I can efficiently manage my events on mobile devices with offline capability, fast loading, and native-like experience while ensuring proper security and access control for different team members**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1:** PWA manifest.json configuration with proper metadata, icons, and display settings
2. **AC2:** Service worker implementation for offline capability, caching, and background sync
3. **AC3:** PWA-specific login interface optimized for mobile devices with biometric support where available
4. **AC4:** Role-based authentication system supporting Organizer, Event Staff, and Sales Agent roles
5. **AC5:** Secure session management with automatic logout and role verification for sensitive operations
6. **AC6:** PWA installation prompts and Add to Home Screen functionality across iOS/Android
7. **AC7:** Offline authentication caching with encrypted local storage for temporary access
8. **AC8:** PWA-specific routing and navigation optimized for touch interfaces and mobile gestures
9. **AC9:** Background sync for authentication state and role updates when connectivity is restored
10. **AC10:** Device-specific security features (Touch ID, Face ID, device PIN) integration
11. **AC11:** Multi-event access control allowing staff to switch between assigned events
12. **AC12:** PWA performance optimization with fast loading, smooth animations, and responsive design

## Dev Technical Guidance

- Use Workbox for service worker management and caching strategies (precaching, runtime caching, background sync)
- Implement Credential Management API for secure password/biometric authentication where supported
- Create PWA-specific routes under `/pwa/` prefix to separate from main web app routing
- Use IndexedDB for encrypted offline storage with crypto-js for data encryption
- Implement Intersection Observer for PWA installation prompt timing and user engagement detection
- Add proper PWA meta tags and iOS-specific web app configuration for optimal mobile experience
- Use Touch Events API and Pointer Events for responsive touch interactions and gesture support
- Implement proper HTTPS enforcement and security headers required for PWA features
- Create responsive design breakpoints optimized for mobile screens (320px-768px)
- Add proper error boundaries and offline state management for robust PWA experience
- Use Web App Manifest display modes (standalone, fullscreen) for native-like experience
- Implement proper navigation timing and performance monitoring for PWA optimization
