### Y. User Network Growth & Friend Invitation Features (Initial Launch)
*(This new section details Friend Invitation features based on recent discussions)*
To facilitate community growth and user connections, the platform will include features for users to find and invite contacts:

* **Y.1. Find Friends/Sync Contacts:**
    * Users will have access to a feature (e.g., within their profile or a dedicated "Friends" section) to find other existing users on the platform or invite new contacts.
    * This will include an option to "Sync Contacts" from their device (via OS-level permissions and dialogs, as conceptualized in the UI/UX Layout PDF) to identify existing friends on SteppersLife.com or contacts to invite.
* **Y.2. Invite Contacts:**
    * Users can invite contacts to join SteppersLife.com.
    * The platform will provide users with a unique **invitation link** that they can copy and share on their preferred social media platforms (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, Twitter) or through other messaging applications.
    * The platform may also provide an option to send invitations via email, if deemed necessary for the Initial Launch.
    * The platform will provide an "Invite Prompt" or interface for accessing these invitation options, as conceptualized in the UI/UX Layout PDF.
* **Y.3. Managing Follows/Friendships:**
    * The platform will support users following each other (as previously discussed for Organizers, Instructors, etc.) and potentially managing "friend" connections or requests, as outlined in the UI/UX Layout PDF.
