# Epic P: User Network Growth & Friend Invitation Features

## Epic Overview
This epic focuses on building the foundational social networking capabilities that will drive organic user growth and community engagement on the SteppersLife platform.

## Business Justification & Why
**Community-driven growth is essential for platform success.** User network effects and viral growth through friend invitations are proven strategies for social platforms, particularly in niche communities like steppers dancing. By enabling users to easily find, connect with, and invite friends, we create multiple benefits:

- **Organic User Acquisition:** Reduce customer acquisition costs through peer-to-peer invitations
- **Enhanced User Retention:** Users with established social connections are significantly more likely to remain active
- **Community Authenticity:** Friend-based growth ensures new users have genuine interest in the steppers community
- **Network Effects:** Each new user adds value for existing users, creating positive feedback loops
- **Competitive Advantage:** Strong social features differentiate us from generic event platforms

## Goals & Objectives
1. **Primary Goal:** Enable seamless friend discovery and invitation to drive organic platform growth
2. **User Experience Goal:** Make connecting with existing friends and inviting new ones intuitive and effortless
3. **Growth Goal:** Establish viral coefficient foundation for sustainable user acquisition
4. **Community Goal:** Foster stronger community bonds through social connections
5. **Retention Goal:** Increase user engagement through social accountability and shared experiences

## Success Metrics & KPIs
- **Invitation Conversion Rate:** % of invited users who join the platform (Target: 15-25%)
- **Contact Sync Adoption:** % of users who sync their contacts (Target: 40-60%)
- **Social Sharing Rate:** % of users who share invitation links on social media (Target: 20-30%)
- **Network Size Growth:** Average number of connections per user over time
- **Viral Coefficient:** Number of new users generated per existing user (Target: >0.3)
- **Friend-based Retention:** Retention rate difference between users with/without connections

## Key Assumptions
- Users are willing to sync device contacts with appropriate privacy controls
- Social media sharing of dance-related content is culturally acceptable in target demographics
- Following/friendship models will translate effectively to the steppers community
- Mobile-first contact access will be the primary discovery method

## Dependencies
- Mobile app contact access permissions and implementation
- Social media API integrations for sharing
- Privacy compliance framework (GDPR, CCPA)
- User authentication and profile system completion
- Notification system for connection requests

## Scope & Timeline
**Initial Launch Scope:** Core friend finding, invitation links, and basic follow system
**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks development + 2 weeks testing
**Future Enhancements:** Advanced matching algorithms, group invitations, referral rewards

## Risk Considerations
- **Privacy Concerns:** Contact data handling must meet all regulatory requirements
- **Spam Prevention:** Invitation system could be misused without proper controls
- **Social Platform Changes:** Dependency on external social media APIs
- **User Adoption:** Success depends on critical mass of early adopters using social features

### P. User Network Growth & Friend Invitation Features (Initial Launch)
*(This new section details Friend Invitation features based on recent discussions)*
To facilitate community growth and user connections, the platform will include features for users to find and invite contacts:

* **P.1. Find Friends/Sync Contacts:**
    * Users will have access to a feature (e.g., within their profile or a dedicated "Friends" section) to find other existing users on the platform or invite new contacts.
    * This will include an option to "Sync Contacts" from their device (via OS-level permissions and dialogs, as conceptualized in the UI/UX Layout PDF) to identify existing friends on SteppersLife.com or contacts to invite.
* **P.2. Invite Contacts:**
    * Users can invite contacts to join SteppersLife.com.
    * The platform will provide users with a unique **invitation link** that they can copy and share on their preferred social media platforms (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, Twitter) or through other messaging applications.
    * The platform may also provide an option to send invitations via email, if deemed necessary for the Initial Launch.
    * The platform will provide an "Invite Prompt" or interface for accessing these invitation options, as conceptualized in the UI/UX Layout PDF.
* **P.3. Managing Follows/Friendships:**
    * The platform will support users following each other (as previously discussed for Organizers, Instructors, etc.) and potentially managing "friend" connections or requests, as outlined in the UI/UX Layout PDF.
