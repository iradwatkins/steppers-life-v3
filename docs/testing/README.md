## Testing Philosophy

Following BMAD principles, testing is integrated into the story implementation process:

1. **Story-Level Testing**: Each story includes acceptance criteria that become test cases
2. **Definition of Done**: Testing requirements are part of story completion checklist
3. **Continuous Testing**: Tests run automatically in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Quality Gates**: Stories cannot be marked "Done" without passing tests

## Test Types

### Unit Tests
- Component testing for React components
- Utility function testing
- Business logic testing
- Coverage target: 80%+

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint testing
- Database interaction testing
- Third-party service integration testing

### End-to-End Tests
- User journey testing
- Critical path validation
- Cross-browser compatibility

### Performance Tests
- Load testing for APIs
- Frontend performance metrics
- Database query performance

### Accessibility Tests
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation testing

## Tools

- **Unit/Integration**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **E2E**: Playwright
- **Performance**: Lighthouse CI, K6
- **Accessibility**: axe-core, WAVE

## BMAD Integration

- **Dev Agents**: Include test implementation in story development
- **SM Agent**: Track testing progress in story completion checklists
- **PO Agent**: Validate acceptance criteria through automated tests

## Current Status

Testing framework being established alongside Epic A & B story implementation.
