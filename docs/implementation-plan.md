# Implementation Plan - BMAD Analysis & Corrected Status

**CRITICAL CORRECTION:** Previous status reports were inaccurate. This analysis is based on actual codebase evidence using the BMAD methodology.

## Business Analysis (B): Current State Assessment

**Reality Check:** The platform currently has extensive UI mockups but minimal backend implementation. Most features marked as "Done" are placeholder components with no working functionality.

## Method (M): Evidence-Based Status Assessment
