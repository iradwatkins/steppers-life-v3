# Implementation Plan - BMAD Analysis & Corrected Status

**CRITICAL UPDATE:** Previous status reports underestimated implementation progress. This analysis is based on the actual code implementation evidence using the BMAD methodology.

## Business Analysis (B): Current State Assessment

**Reality Check:** The platform has extensive UI mockups AND substantial backend implementation. Many critical backend features previously marked as "Missing" are actually implemented and functional.
