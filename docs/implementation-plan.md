# Implementation Plan - BMAD Analysis & Corrected Status

**CRITICAL CORRECTION:** Previous status reports were inaccurate. This analysis is based on actual codebase evidence using the BMAD methodology.

## Business Analysis (B): Current State Assessment

**Reality Check:** The platform currently has extensive UI mockups but minimal backend implementation. Most features marked as "Done" are placeholder components with no working functionality.

## Method (M): Evidence-Based Status Assessment

### Actually Implemented (Backend + Frontend Working)
| Feature ID | Description | Status | Evidence |
|------------|-------------|---------|----------|
| **--- MINIMAL BACKEND INFRASTRUCTURE ---** |
| BE-001 | Basic Category Management API | Done | `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/admin_categories.py` exists |
| BE-002 | Category Schemas | Done | `backend/app/schemas/category.py` with Pydantic models |
| **--- FRONTEND UI SHELLS (NO BACKEND) ---** |
| UI-001 | Component Library & Design System | Done | Extensive Shadcn/UI components, consistent styling |
| UI-002 | Navigation & Routing Structure | Done | React Router setup, route definitions |
| UI-003 | Theme System & Dark Mode | Done | Functional theme switching |
| UI-004 | Responsive Layout Framework | Done | Mobile-responsive components |

### UI Mockups/Placeholders (No Backend Integration)
| Feature Area | Frontend Status | Backend Status | Evidence of Placeholders |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Authentication | UI Exists | **Missing** | No auth API endpoints, no user models |

| Ticketing System | UI Exists | **Missing** | Mock QR codes, no payment integration |
| User Profiles | UI Exists | **Missing** | No user database, mock data |
| PWA Features | UI Exists | **Missing** | No QR scanning backend, mock check-ins |
| Admin Panel | UI Exists | **Missing** | Only categories API, rest is placeholders |
| Analytics | UI Exists | **Missing** | Mock charts, no data pipeline |
| Blog System | UI Exists | **Missing** | No blog API, placeholder content |
| Community Directory | Partial UI | **Missing** | Form exists, no submission backend |
| Classes Module | Partial UI | **Missing** | "VOD Feature Coming Soon" |
| Advertising System | Minimal UI | **Missing** | Only placeholder moderation panel |
| Network/Invitations | No Implementation | **Missing** | No code exists |

## Architecture (A): Technical Infrastructure Gaps

### Missing Core Infrastructure
- **Database Models**: No SQLAlchemy/Django models for users, events, tickets, etc.
- **Authentication System**: No user registration/login backend
- **API Layer**: Only 1 endpoint (categories) of 50+ needed
